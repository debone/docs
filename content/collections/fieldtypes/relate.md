## Relationship Types

You can relate any of the base [Content Types](/content-types), each of which with its own specific fieldtype. They all extend this core Relate fieldtype.

- [Taxonomy](/fieldtypes/taxonomy) - for Taxonomy Terms
- [Collection](/fieldtypes/collection) - for Entries
- [Users](/fieldtypes/users) - for Users
- [Assets](/fieldtypes/assets) - for Assets (it doesn't extend this Relate fieldtype)

## Data Structure {#data-structure}

Content relationships are formed between files through unique IDs. This `id` prevents any disruptions if their slugs, urls, or any other identifying fields are modified.

``` .language-yaml
wildlife:
  - 892jfsd9a90as
  - 134jk1h78dfas
```

### Templating {#templating}

Use the [Relate tag](/tags/relate) to loop through the IDs and fetch the content data.

```
<ul>
  {{ relate:wildlife }}
    <li>{{ title }}</li>
  {{ /relate:wildlife }}
</ul>
```

``` .language-output
<ul>
  <li>Moose</li>
  <li>Squirrel</li>
</ul>
```
